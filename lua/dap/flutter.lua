-- Flutter DAP configuration
-- Note: Flutter DAP is configured directly in lua/plugins/flutter.lua
-- within the flutter-tools.setup() call, as it requires tight integration
-- with the Flutter tools plugin.
--
-- The configuration sets up:
-- - Dart debugger adapter
-- - Launch configurations for Flutter apps
-- - Integration with flutter-tools for run_via_dap
--
-- See lua/plugins/flutter.lua lines 21-38 for the actual configuration.
